https://github.com/lloydst/p80-internship-angular.git . (replace the '.' with a directory if you would want it in a new folder)\nstyling\nscss goes into (or gets imported into) styles.scss in the src folder\nsources:\nThis project was started up with Mean-boilerplate , which is heavely based on the angular-cli and express-gen for the front and backend respectively.\nDescription\nThis project is my internship project at Poort80. The project is supposed to be displayed in a fullscreen browser and to be hosted on a local network, thus removing the need for logging in to admin. The project exists of three 'main' modules:\n\nadmin\nchannels\ncomponents\n\nIn the admin module the content of the components can be changed as well as the order and time a components is displayed on a channel.\nThe components module displays components based on the url. So will ${host}/components/weather display the current weather forecast and ${host}/components/weather-traffic-news will display 3 components(weather,traffic,news).\nThe channels module, opens a extra tab to navigate to a 'custom' component and will display said component for the time defined for the path. After that time/deley is done it will close the tab and open a new one with the next tab and thus next component. once it has finished all the paths it will check the database for the paths to run again, and start all over again.\nDevelopment\nrun npm run dev for rebuilding on changes to any of the angular part of the website.\nand run npm run server (in a other window)so that node restarts the express server on changes\nrun npm run doc to \"generate\" front end docs (only documents the angular app) since the back end can be found at ./api-docs\ngit\nrun npm run git -- Message OR npm run git -- \"Message\" to generate/update the docs folder before a push\nquick component gen (angular cli)\nRun ng generate component componentname to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nstructure\nserver contains all server related stuff.\n\n\"e2e\"  Test related stuff. (for angular only )\n\"src\" angular project.\n\"dist\" the build version of your angular app (compressed)\n\"docs\" documentation generated using type doc\nnode\n\ndatabase\nto connect to a database simple add a .env file in the root and type MONGOURI = connectionstring this can either be a local db or a external one like mlab\nusefull links\ndev: ${host}= localhost:3000\nprod: ${host}=

possible api end points see api documentation for more info\n\ndocs\ndocs can be found at https://lloydst.github.io/p80-internship-angular/ though there is a big chance they are outdated to view the most recent you need to clone the project and run npm run doc:watch (after the npm install ofc) this will generate it in the docs folder and server it on localhost:8080.\nOr you use npm run doc and if the server is running (both npm start and npm run server) you can acces it at (local)host(:port)/docs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n
