The project is supposed to be displayed in a fullscreen browser and to be hosted on a local network, thus removing the need for logging in to admin. The project exists of three 'main' modules:\n\nadmin\nchannels\ncomponents\n\nIn the admin module the content of the components can be changed as well as the order and time a components is displayed on a channel.\nThe components module displays components based on the url. So will ${host}/components/weather display the current weather forecast and ${host}/components/weather-traffic-news will display 3 components(weather,traffic,news).\nThe channels module, opens a extra tab to navigate to a 'custom' component and will display said component for the time defined for the path. After that time/delay is done it will close the tab and open a new one with the next tab and thus next component. once it has finished all the paths it will check the database for changes will run again.\nDevelopment\nrun ng build --watch for rebuilding on changes to any of the angular part of the website.\nand run npm run server (in a other window)so that node restarts the express server on changes\nrun npm run doc to \"generate\" front end docs (only documents the angular app) since the back end can be found at ./api-docs\nquick component gen (angular cli)\nRun ng generate component componentname to generate a new component.

there is a big chance they are outdated to view the most recent you need to clone the project and run npm run doc:watch (after the npm install ofc) this will generate it in the docs folder and server it on localhost:8080.\nOr you use npm run doc and if the server is running (both npm start and npm run server) you can acces it at (local)host(:port)/docs\ndocker\ndocker tends to fail on npm install
